                    <span class="p-e">Philippines</span>, island country of Southeast Asia in the western Pacific Ocean. It is an archipelago consisting of more than 7,000 islands and islets lying about 500 miles (800 km) off the coast of Vietnam. Manila is the capital, but nearby Quezon City is the country’s most-populous city. Both are part of the National Capital Region (Metro Manila), located on Luzon, the largest island. The second largest island of the Philippines is Mindanao, in the southeast.
                    The Philippines takes its name from Philip II, who was king of Spain during the Spanish colonization of the islands in the 16th century. Because it was under Spanish rule for 333 years and under U.S. tutelage for a further 48 years, the Philippines has many cultural affinities with the West. It is, for example, the second most-populous Asian country (following India) with English as an official language and one of only two predominantly Roman Catholic countries in Asia (the other being East Timor). Despite the prominence of such Anglo-European cultural characteristics, the peoples of the Philippines are Asian in consciousness and aspiration.
                    The country was wracked by political turmoil in the last quarter of the 20th century. After enduring more than a decade of authoritarian rule under Pres. Ferdinand Marcos, the broadly popular People Power movement in 1986 led a bloodless uprising against the regime. The confrontation resulted not only in the ouster and exile of Marcos but also in the restoration of democratic government to the Philippines
                    Contemporary Filipinos continue to grapple with a society that is replete with paradoxes, perhaps the most obvious being the presence of extreme wealth alongside tremendous poverty. Rich in resources, the Philippines has the potential to build a strong industrial economy, but the country remains largely agricultural. Especially toward the end of the 20th century, rapid industrial expansion was spurred by a high degree of domestic and foreign investment. That growth, however, simultaneously contributed to severe degradation of the environment. The Philippines also emerged as a regional leader in education during the late 20th century, with a well-established public school and university system, and by the early 21st century the country had one of the highest literacy rates in Asia.

                    The <span class="p-e">land</span> of Philippine archipelago is bounded by the Philippine 
                    Sea to the east, the Celebes Sea to the south, the Sulu Sea to 
                    the southwest, and the South China Sea to the west and north. 
                    The islands spread out in the shape of a triangle, with those 
                    south of Palawan, the Sulu Archipelago, and the island of 
                    Mindanao outlining (from west to east, respectively) its southern 
                    base and the Batan Islands to the north of Luzon forming its 
                    apex. Historically, the total number of islands in the 
                    archipelago was held to be 7,107, but in 2016 the National 
                    Mapping and Resource Information Authority of the Philippines 
                    announced the discovery of more than 500 previously uncharted 
                    islands. The archipelago stretches about 1,150 miles (1,850 km) 
                    from north to south, and its widest east-west extent, at its 
                    southern base, is some 700 miles (1,130 km). The island of Taiwan 
                    lies north of the Batan group, the Malaysian portion of the 
                    island of Borneo is to the south of Palawan, and the eastern 
                    islands of Indonesia lie to the south and southeast of Mindanao. 
                    Only about two-fifths of the islands and islets have names, and 
                    only some 350 have areas of 1 square mile (2.6 square km) or 
                    more. The large islands fall into three groups: (1) the Luzon group in the north and west, consisting of Luzon, Mindoro, and Palawan, (2) the Visayas group in the centre, 
                    consisting of Bohol, Cebu, Leyte, Masbate, Negros, Panay, and Samar, and (3) Mindanao in the south.

                    <span class="p-e">Relief </span> Outstanding physical features of 
                    the Philippines include the irregular configuration of the 
                    archipelago, the coastline of some 22,550 miles (36,290 km), the 
                    great extent of mountainous country, the narrow and interrupted 
                    coastal plains, the generally northward trend of the river 
                    systems, and the spectacular lakes. The islands are composed 
                    primarily of volcanic rock and coral, but all principal rock 
                    formations are present. The mountain ranges for the most part 
                    run in the same general direction as the islands themselves, 
                    approximately north to south. The Cordillera Central, the central 
                    mountain chain of Luzon, running north to the Luzon Strait from 
                    the northern boundary of the central plain, is the most prominent
                    range. It consists of two and in places three parallel ranges, 
                    <img src="pictures/mount apo.jpg" class="mg-2">
                    each with an average elevation of about 5,900 feet (1,800 metres). 
                    The Sierra Madre, extending along the Pacific coast from northern 
                    to central Luzon, is the longest mountain range in the country. 
                    That range and the Cordillera Central merge in north-central 
                    Luzon to form the Caraballo Mountains. To the north of the latter, 
                    and between the two ranges, is the fertile Cagayan Valley. The 
                    narrow Ilocos, or Malayan, range, lying close along the west 
                    coast of northern Luzon, rises in places to elevations above 
                    5,000 feet (1,500 metres) and is seldom below 3,500 feet 
                    (1,000 metres); it is largely volcanic. In the southwestern part 
                    of northern Luzon are the rugged Zambales Mountains, consisting 
                    of more or less isolated old volcanic stocks (rock formed under 
                    great heat and pressure deep beneath the Earth’s surface). Most 
                    of the central plain of Luzon, about 150 by 50 miles 
                    (240 by 80 km), is only about 100 feet (30 metres) above sea 
                    level. The greater part of southern Luzon is occupied by isolated 
                    volcanoes and irregular masses of hills and mountains. 
                    The highest peak is Mayon Volcano (8,077 feet [2,462 metres)]), 
                    near the city of Legaspi (Legazpi) in Albay province on the 
                    island’s Bicol Peninsula in the southeast.
